Public Repository for Minerva's Brave Search Goggles

This repository hosts our [Brave Search Goggles](https://search.brave.com/help/goggles) for use in Lucina content searches.

Brave requires that repositories be public in order to scrape goggle content for use in the API.

Once updated here, Goggles must be submitted on the Brave Search [Goggles Creation Page](https://search.brave.com/goggles/create).
